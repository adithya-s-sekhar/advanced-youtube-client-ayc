## This repo is stil WIP

Project on sourceforge since 2016: https://sourceforge.net/projects/advanced-youtube-client-ayc/

Website: https://advanced-youtube-client-ayc.sourceforge.io/

## How to use

### A. Binary

Binaries are compiled with https://github.com/99fk/Bat-To-Exe-Converter-Downloader

Portable and Installer binaries are available [here](https://advanced-youtube-client-ayc.sourceforge.io)

### B. Run source directly.

1. Download AYClient-Portable.bat, the regular one needs an AppData folder which I'll update later.
2. Create a folder with any name anywhere, on a USB stick or your hard disk.
3. Rename AYClient-Portable.bat to AYClient.bat and copy to the creater folder.
4. Also have ffmpeg.exe and [youtube-dl.exe](https://youtube-dl.org) in the folder.
5. Start AYClient.bat and it'll create the necessary files for further execution.
